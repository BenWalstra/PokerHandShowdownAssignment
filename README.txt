Here are some of the assumptions I made during the assignment:
- That the assignment was referringÂ to a Five-Card Draw Poker game where a player is intimately dealt 5 cards.
- That there was no betting between players.
- That there was no drawing round after all players have received their initial 5 cards.
- That Ace was high.

Essentially the game I made 2 - 6 players are each dealt 5 cards and the player with the better poker hand wins.
